## Features

- Live surveillance of RPi hardware (CPU Temperature, frequency, loads etc.) with customizable warning thresholds
- Detailed software/hardware information (web server, PHP, storage / partition workload, core voltage, plugged USB devices, kernel version, model specifications, OS, CPU, network config)
- Protected access with password login (default: root) ([configure password](https://github.com/femto-code/Rasberry-Pi-Dashboard#configure-password))
- Power (shutdown/reboot) Raspberry Pi with schedule options ([setup instructions](https://github.com/femto-code/Rasberry-Pi-Dashboard#enabling-remote-shutdownreboot-optional))
- Mobile WebApp integration
- Responsive design layout allows usage on all screen sizes
- Dark Theme (manual / auto)

>Update your existing dashboard setup by navigating to project root folder and running `git pull` in the terminal.

## ❗ If you run into issues and getting error message "Permission denied" or "unable to open file" [see issue #22](https://github.com/femto-code/Raspberry-Pi-Dashboard/issues/22) for help and instructions to solve. ❗

## Download and Installation

### Prequisites

- Running Web Server (e.g. Lighttpd or Apache) with PHP installed (>=v5.6)
- Installed Git (comes preinstalled on Raspberry Pi OS / formerly Raspbian as well as other linux distros)

### Setup project

- navigate to your web folder (`cd /var/www/html`)
- clone this Github repository: `git clone https://github.com/femto-code/Rasberry-Pi-Dashboard.git {your_subfolder_name}`
- **DONE!** Open web browser with URL: `http://IP_OF_YOUR_RPI/{your_subfolder_name}`
> Note: replace {your_subfolder_name} with your choice accordingly. You can also rename the base folder at any time afterwards.

## Configuration

#### Core voltage output is not shown
- If you want to see this information on your dashboard instance:<br>run `sudo usermod -aG video www-data` in a terminal
>If you do not use Raspbian (or any other RasPi distro) like Ubuntu, you do have to install `libraspberrypi-bin` by running `sudo apt install libraspberrypi-bin`.

- background: The `vcgencmd` command (specifically dedicated to RPi firmware) is a system command that requires certain hardware rights. Therefore one has to grant this particular right (to read hardware info) to e.g. `www-data` (under which web server is running). This is achived by adding this user to a system group called video, which the standard user pi is part of by default.
- in case of problems: please comment on #12 (or new issue)

#### Enable shutdown / reboot (optional)

> Recommended only, if your RPi is **not** accessible over the Internet!

In order to use the remote power functionality you have to give the user `www-data` advanced rights for running one specific command:
1. Run `sudo visudo` to open the editor for adjusting user rights
2. Be careful what you change here! Just add the following at the **end** of the file: `www-data ALL=NOPASSWD: /sbin/shutdown`
3. Restart your Pi and now shutdown from another device (connected to same local network like your Pi) is possible

#### Configure password (manually)

>You should change the default password (which is **root**) and a choose a more secure one by following the following steps.

>Please be aware that there is a more user-friendly way by using the Dashboards options modal. The manual way of changing the password might be helpful
>- in case of wrong permissions (`www-data` cannot change settings for you - [see issue #22](https://github.com/femto-code/Raspberry-Pi-Dashboard/issues/22) for help and instructions to solve)
>- if password is unknown (and access to Dashboard therefore impossible)

1. Go to [https://www.md5-generator.de/](https://www.md5-generator.de/) and generate the MD5 encyrpted passphrase.
2. Open `local.config` (dynamically created at first start) and apply your custom passphrase string (generated in step 1) as follows (don't alter other lines):
```
[...]
'general' =>
  array (
    [...]
    'pass' => 'YOUR_MD5_PASSPHRASE_HERE',
    [...]
  ),
  [...]
```

4. Remember password and enjoy!
